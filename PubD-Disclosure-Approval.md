_Bristol-Myers Squibb PubD disclosure information. Code was not
submitted for review for this project, instead this disclosure
represents screen shots of the code "in action". Because BMS is no
longer active in virology the components supporting this initiative
(backend and frontend) are "offline", but internal BMS users can find
the codebase in our internal GitHub under `virologydb`_
